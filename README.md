# **Soccer Player Activity Recognition AI System**

---

## **Overview of the Project**

This project focuses on developing an AI system capable of recognizing and analyzing soccer player activities during matches. By automating the identification of actions such as running, passing, and shooting, this system aims to revolutionize player performance analytics and tactical decision-making in soccer.

## **Title**

### Soccer Player Activity Recognition Using AI Systems

---

## **Opening Background Information**

Soccer analysis has traditionally relied on manual tagging of player activities, which is both time-intensive and prone to human error. This project proposes an AI-powered solution to automate player activity recognition. Using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques, the system identifies and categorizes player activities in real time, providing actionable insights for coaches, analysts, and teams.

---

## **General Description of the Current Project**

- The project involves building an AI model that leverages image and video datasets to recognize soccer player activities.
- The system processes live or recorded match footage to classify actions like running, passing, shooting, tackling, and more.
- This AI model will be trained using a dataset of labeled soccer activities and integrated into video analysis platforms to streamline match analytics.

## **Proposed Idea for Enhancements to the Project**

1. **Automated Activity Recognition**  
   Replace manual tagging with AI-based recognition for real-time player activity analysis.
   
2. **Integration with Live Video Feeds**  
   Use the system to analyze activities from live match footage and generate instant performance reports.

3. **Scalable Model Architecture**  
   Develop a flexible model capable of adapting to different leagues, camera angles, and video resolutions.

## **Value and Significance of the Project**

- **Enhanced Analytics**: Automating player activity recognition reduces manual effort and provides consistent, objective results.
- **Real-time Insights**: Instant analysis of player actions during matches aids tactical decision-making.
- **Improved Player Performance**: Detailed metrics help players understand strengths and areas for improvement.

## **Current Limitations**

1. Variability in camera angles and resolutions affecting recognition accuracy.
2. Limited availability of labeled datasets for rare or nuanced soccer actions.
3. Challenges in differentiating between similar activities (e.g., jogging vs. sprinting).

---

## **Literature Review**

1. Research on deep learning techniques for object detection and activity recognition.
2. Study of existing video analysis tools and their limitations in sports analytics.
3. Collaboration with soccer organizations to enhance dataset quality and validate results.

## **Image and Video Dataset Acquisition**

1. **Direct Match Footage**  
   Obtain match footage from public sources or recorded videos of training sessions.
   
2. **Dataset Augmentation**  
   Use data augmentation techniques to increase dataset diversity.

## **Model Training Setup**

### Dataset Preparation
- Organize datasets into folders (`train`, `valid`).
- Use preprocessing techniques like resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

### Training Framework
Use `YOLOv5` or `ResNet` for training the AI model:
```bash
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 300 --data ./data/data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
